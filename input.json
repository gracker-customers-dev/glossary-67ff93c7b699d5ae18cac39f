          "## Description",
          "Risk-Based Authentication (RBA) is an adaptive security measure used in e-commerce and healthcare to enhance user authentication processes by assessing the risk of each login attempt. RBA considers various factors, such as the user's location, device, IP address, and behavior patterns, to determine the risk level associated with the login. If a login attempt is deemed high-risk, the system may prompt the user for additional verification steps, such as two-factor authentication (2FA) or answering security questions. This approach helps balance security with user convenience by applying stricter security measures only when necessary. In e-commerce, RBA can prevent fraudulent transactions without significantly hindering the shopping experience. In healthcare, it ensures that sensitive patient information remains secure while maintaining accessibility for authorized personnel. By dynamically adjusting authentication requirements, RBA provides a flexible security framework that can adapt to the constantly evolving threat landscape.",
          "## Examples",
          "- An e-commerce platform prompts users for 2FA when logging in from an unfamiliar device or location.\n- A healthcare system requests additional identity verification when a user attempts to access sensitive patient records from a public Wi-Fi network.",
          "## Additional Information",

          "## Description",
          "Passwordless authentication is an advanced method of verifying users' identities that eliminates the need for traditional passwords. Instead of relying on passwords, which can be weak, forgotten, or phished, passwordless authentication uses alternative factors such as biometrics (e.g., fingerprint, facial recognition), one-time codes sent via SMS or email, or authentication apps. In the context of e-commerce and healthcare, passwordless authentication enhances security and user experience. For e-commerce, it simplifies the checkout process, reducing cart abandonment rates and increasing conversion by providing a smoother user journey. In healthcare, it ensures secure access to sensitive patient data while complying with strict regulations like HIPAA. By removing passwords from the equation, organizations can significantly reduce the risk of data breaches and identity theft, as there's no password to steal or reuse across sites.",
          "## Examples",
          "- A user logs into an e-commerce site using a one-time code sent to their email instead of a password.\n- A healthcare professional accesses patient records with biometric authentication, such as a fingerprint scan.",

          "Tokenization is a security technique used to protect sensitive information by substituting it with a non-sensitive equivalent, known as a token. The token is a reference or identifier that maps back to the sensitive data but carries no exploitable value. In e-commerce, tokenization protects credit card details by replacing them with a token that can be used to complete transactions without exposing the actual card number. In healthcare, tokenization is used to safeguard patient information, ensuring compliance with regulations such as HIPAA. The original data is stored securely in a centralized token vault, and only authorized systems can map the tokens back to the actual data. This approach minimizes the risk of data breaches, as intercepted tokens cannot be reverse-engineered to reveal the original sensitive information. Tokenization is crucial for maintaining privacy and reducing liability by ensuring that sensitive data is not stored in a way that can be easily accessed by unauthorized parties.",
          "## Examples",
          "- In e-commerce, a credit card number like 1234-5678-9012-3456 is replaced with a token such as ABCD-EFGH-IJKL-MNOP for secure transactions.\n- In healthcare, a patient's Social Security Number is replaced with a token, ensuring privacy when managing medical records.",
          "## Additional Information",
          "- Tokenization differs from encryption as it does not use a mathematical algorithm to mask data, reducing processing overhead.\n- Tokenization helps organizations comply with regulatory standards like PCI DSS in e-commerce and HIPAA in healthcare.",
